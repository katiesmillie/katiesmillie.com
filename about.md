Iâ€™m a California native living in Brooklyn. I just completed 10 week program at the <a href="http://sfpc.io/"> School for Poetic Computation </a> and I blogged about it <a href="http://sfpc.katiesmillie.com/">here.</a> 

Previously, I've worked on products at <a href="https://www.kitchensurfing.com">Kitchensurfing</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gomiso">Miso</a>, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/socialmedia">SocialMedia.com</a>. I was a tech market researcher at <a href="https://www.forrester.com/home/">Forrester Research</a>.  I am passionate about the importance of talking to users and wrote <a href="http://katiesmillie.com/startups-need-to-do-more-user-research/">this blog post</a> about why startups need to do more of it. 


In what feels like a past life, I  worked on political campaigns for two amazing women, <a href="http://www.murray.senate.gov/public/">this one from Washington State</a> in 2004 and <a href="http://www.debgoldberg.com">this one from Massachusetts</a> in 2006. I still believe that we need more females in elected office (among other places). Go Hillary!


I graduated from <a href="http://www.claremontmckenna.edu">Claremont McKenna College</a> in 2005 with a bachelors in Economics and Political Science.  I was a sprinter on the track team. 


I appreciate the symmetry of opposing forces.  I balance my competitive side as a runner with a spiritual yoga practice, healthy eating with periodic days of binging on <a href="http://www.doughbrooklyn.com/">these donuts</a>, and frugality with spontaneous travel.  

Sometimes, I know <a href="https://instagram.com/p/zUvaxNno4W">my way around a kitchen</a>.
