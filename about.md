Hi, I'm Katie.

I just finished attending the <a href="http://sfpc.io/"> School for Poetic Computation </a> and I blogged about my adventures <a href="http://sfpc.katiesmillie.com/">here.</a> 

This summer I'm humbly continuing my education as a programmer and artist: working on <a href="http://twitter.com/missedpoems">Missed Poems</a> and <a href="http://sfpc.katiesmillie.com/post/120134045892/turn-your-screen-time-into-philanthropic-time">Rebalance</a>, and taking courses in Swift and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/webgl">WebGL</a>. 

With the rest of my time, I run a lot, I practice yoga, I just started a sci-fi book club, and sometimes, I know <a href="https://instagram.com/p/zUvaxNno4W">my way around a kitchen</a>. 

I have some availability for product consulting, <a href="/mentoring">mentorship</a>, and stimulating conversations so please get in touch!

Previously, I worked on products at <a href="https://www.kitchensurfing.com">Kitchensurfing</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/miso">Miso</a>, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/socialmedia">SocialMedia.com</a> and wrote about the tech market at <a href="https://www.forrester.com/home/">Forrester Research</a>.  I am passionate about the importance of talking to users and wrote [this blog post][post] about why startups need to do more of it. 


In what feels like a past life, I  worked on political campaigns for two amazing women, <a href="http://www.murray.senate.gov/public/">this one from Washington State</a> in 2004 and <a href="http://www.debgoldberg.com">this one from Massachusetts</a> in 2006. We still need to elect a lot more females to office (among other places).

I have a bachelors in Economics and Political Science from <a href="http://www.claremontmckenna.edu">Claremont McKenna College</a>, where I was also a sprinter on the track team.
