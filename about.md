Hi, I'm Katie.

I'm currently seeking an internship or an entry level job as a mobile developer.

This summer I've been teaching myself Swift and loving it so far. I built my first iOS app called <a href="http://twitter.com/helloroundtrip">RoundTrip</a>, which will soon be available in the app store. 

In the spring, I attended the <a href="http://sfpc.io/"> School for Poetic Computation </a> and I blogged about my adventures <a href="http://sfpc.katiesmillie.com/">here.</a> 

Aside from coding and art projects I run a lot, I practice yoga, I just started a sci-fi book club, and sometimes, I know <a href="https://instagram.com/p/zUvaxNno4W">my way around a kitchen</a>. 

I also have some limited availability for product consulting and user research, so please get in touch!

Previously, I worked on products at <a href="https://www.kitchensurfing.com">Kitchensurfing</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/miso">Miso</a>, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/socialmedia">SocialMedia.com</a> and wrote about the tech market at <a href="https://www.forrester.com/home/">Forrester Research</a>.  I am passionate about the importance of talking to users and wrote [this blog post][post] about why startups need to do more of it. 


In what feels like a past life, I  worked on political campaigns for two amazing women, <a href="http://www.murray.senate.gov/public/">this one from Washington State</a> in 2004 and <a href="http://www.debgoldberg.com">this one from Massachusetts</a> in 2006. We still need to elect a lot more females to office (among other places).

I have a bachelors in Economics and Political Science from <a href="http://www.claremontmckenna.edu">Claremont McKenna College</a>, where I was also a sprinter on the track team.
