Hi, I'm Katie. 

I'm currently an iOS developer at <a href="https://lono.io">Lono</a>. 

I used to be a product manager, but about a year I took a break to attend the<a href="http://sfpc.katiesmillie.com/"> School for Poetic Computation </a>. Following that I decided I wanted to learn Swift and I never looked back. This is my first iOS app,<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roundtrip-mta/id1023476036?ls=1&mt=8">RoundTrip</a>.

Aside from coding and art projects I run a lot, I hang out upside down, I host a sci-fi book club, and sometimes, I know <a href="https://instagram.com/p/zUvaxNno4W">my way around a kitchen</a>.

In my past work experience, I helped build products at <a href="https://www.kitchensurfing.com">Kitchensurfing</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/miso">Miso</a>, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/socialmedia">SocialMedia.com</a> and wrote about the tech market at <a href="https://www.forrester.com/home/">Forrester Research</a>.  I also like to [preach about the power of talking to your users][post].

In what feels like a past life, I  worked on political campaigns for two amazing women, <a href="http://www.murray.senate.gov/public/">this one from Washington State</a> in 2004 and <a href="http://www.debgoldberg.com">this one from Massachusetts</a> in 2006. 

I have a bachelors in Economics and Political Science from <a href="http://www.claremontmckenna.edu">Claremont McKenna College</a>, where I was also a sprinter on the track team.
