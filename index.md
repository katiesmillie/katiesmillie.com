Hi, I’m Katie.

I’m a freelance iOS developer based in Brooklyn, though you can often find me in other places including the Hudson Valley, the Maine coast, and California (where I grew up).

I’m currently working on <a href="http://urbanarchive.nyc">Urban Archive</a>, an app for exploring the history of NYC.  I created the first version of Urban Archive in the fall of 2016, as part of the founding team based out of  <a href="https://orbital.nyc/">Orbital NYC.</a>  

While building Urban Archive over the last 3 years, I’ve also worked with <a href="http://breaker.audio">Breaker</a>, a new social podcast app, and <a href="https://medium.com/positiveslope/prefer-postmortem-6-lessons-learned-from-building-an-independent-pro-network-17f398da002">Prefer</a>, a referral network app for independent professionals. Before that, my first role as an iOS developer was helping to launch <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lono">Lono</a>, an app to control a smart sprinkler device.

In each role as an iOS developer, I’ve shaped early product direction, guiding apps from betas, to MVP App Store releases, and through early feature iterations.  

This stage of product development is my sweet spot, and stems from my experience as a product manager at early stage startups:  <a href="https://www.kitchensurfing.com">Kitchensurfing</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/miso">Miso</a>, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/socialmedia">SocialMedia.com</a>. In terms of style, I would call myself a user experience focused PM and a product engineer. I’ve also been known to [preach about the power of talking to your users][post]

In the spring of 2015, I attended the <a href="http://sfpc.katiesmillie.com/">School for Poetic Computation</a>. That experience inspired me to learn Swift and make mobile apps full-time. I wrote my first app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roundtrip-mta/id1023476036?ls=1&mt=8">RoundTrip</a>, in 30 days and over 30K people have read <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/from-zero-to-swift-in-30-days-8ad97b630e00/">my blog post about it</a>. 

Before working at software product companies, I did tech market research at <a href="https://www.forrester.com/home/">Forrester Research</a> and worked on the political campaigns of two women (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray">Patty Murray</a> for US Senate in 2004, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_Goldberg">Deb Goldberg</a> for Lt Governor in 2006).

I enjoy many things outside of coding including running, hosting a sci-fi book club, sailing, and cooking in <a href="https://fieldcompany.com/">Field Company cast iron skillets</a>.
