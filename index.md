Hi, I'm Katie. 

I'm a freelance iOS developer splitting time between in Brooklyn and High Falls, NY. My current projects are <a href="http://urbanarchive.nyc">Urban Archive</a>, an app for exploring the history of NYC and <a href="http://breaker.audio">Breaker, a social podcast app focused on discovery.</a>.

I'm always open to talking about ideas and new projects.

Formerly a product manager, 2 years ago I took a break to attend the<a href="http://sfpc.io/"> School for Poetic Computation</a>. Following that program, I decided I wanted to learn Swift and make mobile apps full-time. I wrote my first app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roundtrip-mta/id1023476036?ls=1&mt=8">RoundTrip</a>, in 30 days. It helps you track your subway rides and manage the fare on your MTA card. Soon after I landed my first iOS job developing a Swift app for <a href="https://lono.io">Lono</a>.  

My previous experience had me managing products at <a href="https://www.kitchensurfing.com">Kitchensurfing</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/miso">Miso</a>, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/socialmedia">SocialMedia.com</a>. I also wrote about the technology market at <a href="https://www.forrester.com/home/">Forrester Research</a>. Throughout my career I've continued to [preach about the power of talking to your users][post].

Aside from coding and art projects I run a lot, I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BA7XeuCno6A/">hang out upside down</a>, I host a sci-fi book club, and sometimes, I know <a href="https://instagram.com/p/zUvaxNno4W">my way around a kitchen</a>. 

Reach out! I'm always excited to chat about new ideas or projects.
