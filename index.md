Hi, I'm Katie. 

I'm currently seeking opporuntities as a mobile developer.  I also have expertise in product management and user research and I'm open to combining these things in interesting ways.

This summer I've been teaching myself Swift and loving it. I built my first iOS app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roundtrip-mta/id1023476036?ls=1&mt=8">RoundTrip</a>, which is now available in the app store.  Earlier this spring, I attended the <a href="http://sfpc.io/"> School for Poetic Computation </a> and <a href="http://sfpc.katiesmillie.com/">wrote about all my adventures here.</a> 

Aside from coding and art projects I run a lot, I practice yoga, I just started a sci-fi book club, and sometimes, I know <a href="https://instagram.com/p/zUvaxNno4W">my way around a kitchen</a>. 

Previously, I worked on products at <a href="https://www.kitchensurfing.com">Kitchensurfing</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/miso">Miso</a>, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/socialmedia">SocialMedia.com</a> and wrote about the tech market at <a href="https://www.forrester.com/home/">Forrester Research</a>.  I believe in the power of talking to your users and wrote [this blog post][post] about why startups need to do more of it. 

In what feels like a past life, I  worked on political campaigns for two amazing women, <a href="http://www.murray.senate.gov/public/">this one from Washington State</a> in 2004 and <a href="http://www.debgoldberg.com">this one from Massachusetts</a> in 2006. We still need to elect a lot more females to office (among other places).

I have a bachelors in Economics and Political Science from <a href="http://www.claremontmckenna.edu">Claremont McKenna College</a>, where I was also a sprinter on the track team.
