Hi, I'm Katie. 

I'm currently a freelance iOS developer living in Brooklyn. I'm currently working on <a href="http://urbanarchive.nyc">Urban Archive</a>. and <a href="http://breaker.audio">Breaker</a>, but also open to learn about new projects. 

I am a former product manager and 2 years I took a break to attend the<a href="http://sfpc.io/"> School for Poetic Computation</a>. After that, I decided I wanted to learn Swift and I never looked back. My first app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roundtrip-mta/id1023476036?ls=1&mt=8">RoundTrip</a>, helps you track your subway rides and manage the fare on your MTA card. My first iOS job was developing a Swift app for <a href="https://lono.io">Lono</a>.  

Aside from coding and art projects I run a lot, I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BA7XeuCno6A/">hang out upside down</a>, I host a sci-fi book club, and sometimes, I know <a href="https://instagram.com/p/zUvaxNno4W">my way around a kitchen</a>.

My past experience had me working on products at <a href="https://www.kitchensurfing.com">Kitchensurfing</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/miso">Miso</a>, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/socialmedia">SocialMedia.com</a> and I wrote about the tech market at <a href="https://www.forrester.com/home/">Forrester Research</a>.  I also like to [preach about the power of talking to your users][post].

And my very first (of now several) careers, I  worked on political campaigns for two kick-ass women, <a href="http://www.murray.senate.gov/public/">this one from Washington State</a> in 2004 and <a href="http://www.debgoldberg.com">this one from Massachusetts</a> in 2006. 

I have a bachelors in Economics and Political Science from <a href="http://www.claremontmckenna.edu">Claremont McKenna College</a>, where I was also a sprinter on the track team.
