**I am available for chats and longer term mentoring relationships*** when it makes sense. There have been amazing people in my life who have helped me along the way and given me encouragement when I felt stuck. 

My past experiences are varied so I'm open to any conversation, but in particular I think I would be good at helping with:

- Product management: the role and the process
- User research / interviewing / testing of all kinds! 
- How to easily prototype and validate your ideas in the market (no technical skills required)
- Surviving life at a tech startup, as a woman or as a human
- Switching careers / finding your path
- Teaching yourself how to code

If you’d like to get in touch, you can email me and tell me about yourself, some suggestions:

- How did you become who you are, and who do you want to become?
- What do you hope to gain from our mentoring relationship?
- What’s the best thing you’ve read, watched, or listened to lately?
- What work have you done that you’re proud of?


**I am also seeking mentors*** as I continue on my journey as a programmer and an artist (sometimes together, sometimes apart).
